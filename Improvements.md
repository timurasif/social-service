# System Improvements

Please note that these improvements are mentioned while keeping the current scope of functional requirements in mind.
With the addition of new requirements, these recommendations may need to be adjusted.
Changes in system design, choice of database and redesigning of the architecture might also be necessary to accommodate any future enhancements.

## Testing
- Implement test cases (unit, integration, acceptance etc.)

## Monitoring and Logging
- Performance monitoring, alerting and logging mechanisms to monitor system health and performance (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack can be used)

## Image Optimization
- Compression and decompression of image files for efficient storage

## Scalability

### Microservices Architecture
- Breaking down the system into different microservices (posts, comments, newsfeed etc) to improve scalability and maintainability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Horizontal scaling to balance load, increase throughput, reduce latency, and mitigate the risk of single point of failure

### Data Management
- Replication for providing higher availability and faster read performance
- Data can be partitioned using sharding to distribute the load across multiple instances of the database

### Elastic Infrastructure
- Elastic infrastructure to autoscale the system according to the load and for better resource utilization (aws beanstalk, k8s horizontal pod autoscaler can be used)

## Fault Tolerance
- Circuit breakers (Hystrix in Spring ecosystem), retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation mechanisms to handle failures and make the system more resilient

## API Gateway
- API gateway layer can be added for user authentication and authorization (Spring Cloud Gateway or Netflix Zuul can be used in Spring ecosystem)

## Caching
- Adding cache to store frequently accessed data and improve response times for read-heavy operations (Redis or memcached including others can be used)

## CDN
- CDN linked with the blob storage (GCS) to serve image data efficiently based on geographic locations of the users and reduce latency (AWS Cloudfront or Cloudflare including others can be used)

## Asynchronous Processing
- Asynchronous or parallel processing for compute-heavy or long-running tasks (image processing etc) to improve system responsiveness, throughput and scalability (multithreading, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS/SNS)

## Rate Limiting
- Rate limiting can be applied to prevent overuse or abuse of system resources

## CI/CD pipeline
- CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment processes and ensure quick and reliable delivery (Jenkins, Github Actions etc)

## Optimized Newsfeed
- Enhanced and optimized newsfeed generation algorithms
